/**
 * Program:     Missile Command - COSC101 Assignment 3
 * Authors:     Simon Colman, Nathan Hall, Kris Martin - Group 16
 * Version:     1.0
 * Date:        17/05/2021
 *
 *
 * Requirements:
 * This program needs Processing and the Processing Sound library installed to
 * function.
 *
 * Installation:
 * 1) If you have not already installed Processing on your computer please
 * follow the instructions on https://processing.org/download/ to install it.
 * 2) Then install the sound library following the instructions from
 * https://processing.org/reference/libraries/.
 * 3) Once Processing is installed simply download the a3 zip folder, unzip it,
 * double click the file a3.pde which will open in processing, then click play.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Open a3.pde and click the processing play button to start program. You will
 * be presented with the main menu screen. Click options to adjust music volume
 * for both game and menu music, or click start game to play. After starting the
 * game you can pause by hitting space, and a pause menu will appear - you can 
 * then choose to return to the game or quit the game by returning to the main 
 * menu.

 * When the game starts you have 6 cities to defend and one missile defence
 * system/cannon to defend them with. Move the mouse to aim the cannon and
 * click to shoot. Enemy missiles will rain down in waves from the top of the
 * screen. It is your job to block as many missiles as you can with your
 * cannon. Aim your shot to intersect with the missileâ€™s trajectory and the
 * missile will be destroyed. Miss and if the missile hits a city, the city
 * will take damage. Once a city has taken too much damage it will be
 * destroyed.
 *
 * The game is over when all six cities have been destroyed. Good luck!
